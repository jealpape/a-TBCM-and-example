% CollisionForces: Function implementing the computation of the 
% collision forces produced during closure phase in accordance to the  
% triangular body-cover model of the vocal folds.
%
% Structure: [Fu_col,Fl_col] = TotalCollisionForces(TBCMobj)
% where
%
% BCMObj: is an object from BodyCoverModel (handle) class,
% Fu_col: is the collision force in the upper mass,
% Fl_col: is the collision force in the lower mass.
